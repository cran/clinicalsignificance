\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy data frame}

\item{id}{Participant ID}

\item{time}{Time variable}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable}

\item{group}{Grouping variable (optional)}

\item{pre}{Pre measurement (only needed if the time variable contains more
than two measurements)}

\item{post}{Post measurement (only needed if the time variable contains more
than two measurements)}

\item{pct_improvement}{Numeric, percent change that indicates a clinically
significant improvement}

\item{pct_deterioration}{Numeric, percent change that indicates a clinically
significant deterioration (optional). If this is not set,
\code{pct_deterioration} will be assumed to be equal to \code{pct_improvement}}

\item{better_is}{Which direction means a better outcome for the used
instrument? Available are
\itemize{
\item \code{"lower"} (lower outcome scores are desirable, the default) and
\item \code{"higher"} (higher outcome scores are desirable)
}}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{cs_analysis} and \code{cs_percentage}
}
\description{
\code{cs_percentage()} can be used to determine the clinical
significance of intervention studies employing the percentage-change
approach. For this, each individuals relative change compared to the pre
intervention measurement and if this change exceeds a predefined change in
percent points, this change is then deemed clinically significant.
}
\section{Computational details}{
 Each participants change is calculated and
then divided by the pre intervention score to estimate the individual's
percent change. A percent change for an improvement as well as a
deterioration can be provided separately and if \code{pct_deterioration} is not
set, it will be assumed to be the same as \code{pct_improvement}.
}

\section{Categories}{
 Each individual's change may then be categorized into
one of the following three categories:
\itemize{
\item Improved, the change is greater than the predefined percent change in
the beneficial direction
\item Unchanged, the change is within the predefined percent change
\item Deteriorated, the change is greater than the predefined percent change,
but in the disadvantageous direction
}
}

\section{Data preparation}{
 The data set must be tidy, which corresponds to a
long data frame in general. It must contain a patient identifier which must
be unique per patient. Also, a column containing the different measurements
and the outcome must be supplied. Each participant-measurement combination
must be unique, so for instance, the data must not contain two "After"
measurements for the same patient.

Additionally, if the measurement column contains only two values, the first
value based on alphabetical, numerical or factor ordering will be used as
the \code{pre} measurement. For instance, if the column contains the
measurements identifiers \code{"pre"} and \code{"post"} as strings, then \code{"post"}
will be sorted before \code{"pre"} and thus be used as the \code{"pre"} measurement.
The function will throw a warning but generally you may want to explicitly
define the \code{"pre"} and \code{"post"} measurement with arguments \code{pre} and
\code{post}. In case of more than two measurement identifiers, you have to
define \code{pre} and \code{post} manually since the function does not know what your
pre and post intervention measurements are.

If your data is grouped, you can specify the group by referencing the
grouping variable (see examples below). The analysis is then run for every
group to compare group differences.
