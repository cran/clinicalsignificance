A fictional complete dataset to exemplify the use of HLM method for clinical

}
\details{
In a fictional clinical trial, participants were split up to belong to either
a medical placebo ("Placebo") or psychotherapeutic intervention
("Intervention") group.

They underwent outpatient treatment during which they were followed for 5
measurements at which a fictional anxiety score was measured. This anxiety
score may range from 0 - 60.

The functional population (i.e., non-anxious
individuals) can be expected to have a mean score of M = 8 points with a
standard deviation of SD = 4.
