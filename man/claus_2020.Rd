\description{
A dataset containing the data from Claus et al. (2020). In a routine
inpatient setting for unipolar depressive disorders they implemented an
intervention that sought to amplify the placebo response of antidepressants.
In the study, two groups were compared: treatment as usual (TAU) and placebo
amplification (PA). Participants were examined four times during their
treatment.
