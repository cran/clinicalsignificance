\item{mid_improvement}{Numeric, change that indicates a clinically
significant improvement}

\item{better_is}{Which direction means a better outcome for the used

\item{target}{String, whether an individual or group analysis should be
calculated. Available are
\itemize{

evaluated

}}

\item{effect}{String, if \code{target = "group"}, specify which effect should be

\item{ci_level}{Numeric, define the credible or confidence interval level.

\description{
\code{cs_anchor()} can be used to determine the clinical significance
of intervention studies employing the anchor-based approach. For this, a
predefined minimally important difference (MID) for an instrument is known
that corresponds to an important symptom improvement for patients. The data
can then be analyzed on the individual as well as the group level to
estimate, if the change because of an intervention is clinically
significant.
}
\section{Computational details}{
 For the individual-level analyses, the
analysis is straight forward. An MID can be specified for an improvement as
well as a deterioration (because these must not necessarily be identical)
and the function basically counts how many patients fall within the MID
range for both, improvement and deterioration, or how many patients exceed
the limits of this range in either direction. A patient may than be
categorized as:
\itemize{
\item Improved, the patient demonstrated a change that is equal or greater then
the MID for an improvement
\item Unchanged, the patient demonstrated a change that is less than both MIDs
\item Deteriorated, the patient demonstrated a change that is equal or greater
then the MID for a deterioration
}

For group-level analyses, the whole sample is either treated as a single
group or is split up by grouping presented in the data. For within group
analyses, the function calculates the median change from pre to post
intervention with the associated credible interval (CI). Based on the
median change and the limits of this CI, a group change can be categorized
in 5 distinctive categories:
\itemize{
\item Statistically not significant, the CI contains 0
\item Statistically significant but not clinically relevant, the CI does not
contain 0, but the median and both CI limits are beneath the MID threshold
\item Not significantly less than the threshold, the MID threshold falls within
the CI but the median is still below that threshold
\item Probably clinically significant effect, the median crossed the MID
threshold but the threshold is still inside the CI
\item Large clinically significant effect, the median crossed the MID threshold
and the CI does not contain the threshold
}

If a between group comparison is desired, a reference group can be defined
with the \code{reference_group} argument to which all subsequent groups are
compared. This is usually an inactive comparator such as a placebo or
wait-list control group. The difference between the pairwise compared
groups is categorized just as the within group difference above, so the
same categories apply.

The approach can be changed to a classical frequentist framework for which
the point estimate then represents the mean difference and the CI a
confidence interval. For an extensive overview over the differences between
a Bayesian and frequentist CI, refer to Hespanhol et al. (2019).

\section{Data preparation}{
 The data set must be tidy, which corresponds to a
long data frame in general. It must contain a patient identifier which must
be unique per patient. Also, a column containing the different measurements
and the outcome must be supplied. Each participant-measurement combination
must be unique, so for instance, the data must not contain two "After"
measurements for the same patient.

Additionally, if the measurement column contains only two values, the first
value based on alphabetical, numerical or factor ordering will be used as
the \code{pre} measurement. For instance, if the column contains the
measurements identifiers \code{"pre"} and \code{"post"} as strings, then \code{"post"}
will be sorted before \code{"pre"} and thus be used as the \code{"pre"} measurement.
The function will throw a warning but generally you may want to explicitly
define the \code{"pre"} and \code{"post"} measurement with arguments \code{pre} and
\code{post}. In case of more than two measurement identifiers, you have to
define \code{pre} and \code{post} manually since the function does not know what your
pre and post intervention measurements are.

If your data is grouped, you can specify the group by referencing the
grouping variable (see examples below). The analysis is then run for every
group to compare group differences.
