\arguments{
\item{x}{A clinisig object}

\item{lower_limit}{Numeric, lower plotting limit. Defaults to 0}

\item{upper_limit}{Numeric, upper plotting limit. Defaults to 100}

\item{rci_fill}{String, a color (name or HEX code) for RCI filling}

\item{rci_alpha}{Numeric, controls the transparency of the RCI. This can be
any value between 0 and 1.}

\item{diagonal_color}{String, a color (name or HEX code) for the line
indicating no change.}

\item{show}{String. You have several options to color different features. Available are
\itemize{
\item \code{"category"} (shows all categories at once) which is the default
\item \code{"recovered"} (shows recovered participants)
\item \code{"improved"} (shows improved participants)
\item \code{"unchanged"} (shows unchanged participants)
\item \code{"deteriorated"} (shows deteriorated participants, if available)
\item \code{"harmed"} (shows harmed participants, if available)
}}

\item{which}{String. Which plot type should be shown? Defaults to \code{"point"}
which yields the default clinical significance plot. The HLM method
incorporates multiple measurements per participant, so a reduction to pre
and post values may remove important information. Therefore, you can
additionally choose to plot either
\itemize{
\item each participants trajectory (with \code{"trajectory"}), or
\item each participants fitted Empirical Bayes slope (with \code{"slope"})
}}

\item{include_cutoff}{Logical. Should the clinical cutoff be plotted as well?
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{include_cutoff_band}{Logical. If method was HA, a region of uncertainty
around the cutoff can be plotted}

\item{x_lab}{String, x axis label. Default is \code{"Pre"} for point and
\code{"Measurement"} for trajectory and slope plot.}

\item{y_lab}{String, y axis label. Default is \code{"Post"} for point, \code{"Outcome Score"} for trajectory, and \code{"Fitted Score"} for slope plot.}

\item{color_lab}{String, color guide label. Default is \code{"Group"}.}

\item{overplotting}{Numeric, control amount of overplotting. Defaults to 0.02
(i.e., 2\% of range between lower and upper limit).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 plot
}
\description{
Plot the results of a clinical significance analysis.
}
\details{
The resulting plot is a generic clinical significance plot with
pre-intervention assessment scores on the x-axis and post-intervention
assessment scores on the y-axis. By default, the cutoff between the clinical
and functional population is plotted as well as the RCI band.
