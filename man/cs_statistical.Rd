\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy data frame}

\item{id}{Participant ID}

\item{time}{Time variable}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable}

\item{group}{Grouping variable (optional)}

\item{pre}{Pre measurement (only needed if the time variable contains more
than two measurements)}

than two measurements)}

\item{m_functional}{Numeric, mean of functional population.}

\item{sd_functional}{Numeric, standard deviation of functional population}

\item{reliability}{The instrument's reliability estimate. If you selected the
NK method, the here specified reliability will be the instrument's pre
measurement reliability. Not needed for the HLM method.}

\item{better_is}{Which direction means a better outcome for the used
instrument? Available are
\itemize{
\item \code{"lower"} (lower outcome scores are desirable, the default) and

}}

\item{cutoff_method}{Cutoff method, Available are
\itemize{
\item \code{"JT"} (Jacobson & Truax, 1991, the default)
\item \code{"HA"} (Hageman & Arrindell, 1999)
}}

\item{cutoff_type}{Cutoff type. Available are \code{"a"}, \code{"b"}, and \code{"c"}.
Defaults to \code{"a"} but \code{"c"} is usually recommended. For \code{"b"} and \code{"c"},
summary data from a functional population must be given with arguments
\code{m_functional} and \code{sd_functional}.}

\item{significance_level}{Significance level alpha, defaults to \code{0.05}. If
you choose the \code{"HA"} method, this value corresponds to the maximum risk of

\description{
\code{cs_statistical()} can be used to determine the clinical
significance of intervention studies employing the statistical approach. For
this, it will be assumed that the functional (non-clinical population) and
patient (clinical population) scores form two distinct distributions on a
continuum. \code{cs_statistical()} calculates a cutoff point between these two
populations and counts, how many patients changed from the clinical to the
functional population during intervention. Several methods for calculating
this cutoff are available.
}
\section{Computational details}{
 There are three available cutoff types, namely
a, b, and c which can be used to "draw a line" or separate the functional
and clinical population on a continuum. a as a cutoff is defined as the mean
of the clinical population minus two times the standard deviation (SD) of
the clinical population. b is defined as the mean of the functional
population plus also two times the SD of the clinical population. This is
true for "negative" outcomes, where a lower instrument score is desirable.
For "positive" outcomes, where higher scores are beneficial, a is the mean
of the clinical population plus 2 \eqn{\cdot} SD of the clinical population
and b is mean of the functional population minus 2 \eqn{\cdot} SD of the
clinical population. The summary statistics for the clinical population are
estimated from the provided data at pre measurement.

c is defined as the midpoint between both populations based on their
respective mean and SD. In order to calculate b and c, descriptive
statistics for the functional population must be provided.
}

\section{Categories}{
 Individual patients can be categorized into one of the
following groups:
\itemize{
\item Improved, i.e., one changed from the clinical to the functional population
\item Unchanged, i.e., one can be seen as a member of the same population pre
and post intervention
\item Deteriorated, i.e., one changed from the functional to the clinical
population during intervention
}
}

\section{Data preparation}{
 The data set must be tidy, which corresponds to a
long data frame in general. It must contain a patient identifier which must
be unique per patient. Also, a column containing the different measurements
and the outcome must be supplied. Each participant-measurement combination
must be unique, so for instance, the data must not contain two "After"
measurements for the same patient.

Additionally, if the measurement column contains only two values, the first
value based on alphabetical, numerical or factor ordering will be used as
the \code{pre} measurement. For instance, if the column contains the
measurements identifiers \code{"pre"} and \code{"post"} as strings, then \code{"post"}
will be sorted before \code{"pre"} and thus be used as the \code{"pre"} measurement.
The function will throw a warning but generally you may want to explicitly
define the \code{"pre"} and \code{"post"} measurement with arguments \code{pre} and
\code{post}. In case of more than two measurement identifiers, you have to
define \code{pre} and \code{post} manually since the function does not know what your
pre and post intervention measurements are.

If your data is grouped, you can specify the group by referencing the
grouping variable (see examples below). The analysis is then run for every
group to compare group differences.
