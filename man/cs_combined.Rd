\item{id}{Participant ID}

\item{time}{Time variable}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable}

\item{group}{Grouping variable (optional)}

\item{pre}{Pre measurement (only needed if the time variable contains more
than two measurements)}

than two measurements)}

\item{mid_improvement}{Numeric, change that indicates a clinically
significant improvement}

significant deterioration (optional). If \code{mid_deterioration} is not
provided, it will be assumed to be equal to \code{mid_improvement}}

\item{reliability}{The instrument's reliability estimate. If you selected the
NK method, the here specified reliability will be the instrument's pre
measurement reliability. Not needed for the HLM method.}

\item{reliability_post}{The instrument's reliability at post measurement
(only needed for the NK method)}

\item{m_functional}{Numeric, mean of functional population.}

\item{sd_functional}{Numeric, standard deviation of functional population}

\item{better_is}{Which direction means a better outcome for the used
instrument? Available are
\itemize{
\item \code{"lower"} (lower outcome scores are desirable, the default) and
\item \code{"higher"} (higher outcome scores are desirable)
}}

\item{rci_method}{Clinical significance method. Available are
\itemize{

\item \code{"EN"} (Edwards & Nunnally; Speer, 1992)
\item \code{"NK"} (Nunnally & Kotsch, 1983), requires a reliability estimate at post
measurement. If this is not supplied, reliability and reliability_post are
assumed to be equal
\item \code{"HA"} (Hageman & Arrindell, 1999)
\item \code{"HLM"} (Hierarchical Linear Modeling; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002),
requires at least three measurements per patient
}}

\item{cutoff_type}{Cutoff type. Available are \code{"a"}, \code{"b"}, and \code{"c"}.
Defaults to \code{"a"} but \code{"c"} is usually recommended. For \code{"b"} and \code{"c"},
summary data from a functional population must be given with arguments
\code{m_functional} and \code{sd_functional}.}

\item{significance_level}{Significance level alpha, defaults to \code{0.05}. If
you choose the \code{"HA"} method, this value corresponds to the maximum risk of
misclassification}

\description{
\code{cs_combined()} can be used to determine the clinical
significance of intervention studies employing the combination of the
distribution-based and statistical approach. For this, it will be assumed
that the functional (non-clinical population) and patient (clinical
population) scores form two distinct distributions on a continuum.
\code{cs_combined()} calculates a cutoff point between these two populations as
well as a reliable change index (RCI) based on a provided instrument
reliability estimate and counts, how many of those patients that showed a
reliable change (that is likely to be not due to measurement error)
switched from the clinical to the functional population during
intervention. Several methods for calculating the cutoff and RCI are
available.
}
\section{Categories}{
 Each individual's change can then be categorized into
the following groups:
\itemize{
\item Recovered, i.e., the individual showed a reliable change in the beneficial direction and changed from the clinical to the functional population
\item Improved, i.e., the individual showed a reliable change in the beneficial direction but did not change populations
\item Unchanged, i.e., the individual showed no reliable change
\item Deteriorated, i.e., the individual showed a reliable change in the disadvantageous direction but did not change populations
\item Harmed, i.e., the individual showed a reliable change in the disadvantageous direction and switched from the functional to the clinincal population
}
}

\section{Computational details}{
 There are three available cutoff types, namely
a, b, and c which can be used to "draw a line" or separate the functional
and clinical population on a continuum. a as a cutoff is defined as the mean
of the clinical population minus two times the standard deviation (SD) of
the clinical population. b is defined as the mean of the functional
population plus also two times the SD of the clinical population. This is
true for "negative" outcomes, where a lower instrument score is desirable.
For "positive" outcomes, where higher scores are beneficial, a is the mean
of the clinical population plus 2 \eqn{\cdot} SD of the clinical population
and b is mean of the functional population minus 2 \eqn{\cdot} SD of the
clinical population. The summary statistics for the clinical population are
estimated from the provided data at pre measurement.

c is defined as the midpoint between both populations based on their
respective mean and SD. In order to calculate b and c, descriptive
statistics for the functional population must be provided.

 From the provided data, a region of change is
calculated in which an individual change may likely be due to an inherent
measurement of the used instrument. This concept is also known as the
minimally detectable change (MDC).
}

\section{Data preparation}{
 The data set must be tidy, which corresponds to a
long data frame in general. It must contain a patient identifier which must
be unique per patient. Also, a column containing the different measurements
and the outcome must be supplied. Each participant-measurement combination
must be unique, so for instance, the data must not contain two "After"
measurements for the same patient.

Additionally, if the measurement column contains only two values, the first
value based on alphabetical, numerical or factor ordering will be used as
the \code{pre} measurement. For instance, if the column contains the
measurements identifiers \code{"pre"} and \code{"post"} as strings, then \code{"post"}
will be sorted before \code{"pre"} and thus be used as the \code{"pre"} measurement.
The function will throw a warning but generally you may want to explicitly
define the \code{"pre"} and \code{"post"} measurement with arguments \code{pre} and
\code{post}. In case of more than two measurement identifiers, you have to
define \code{pre} and \code{post} manually since the function does not know what your
pre and post intervention measurements are.

If your data is grouped, you can specify the group by referencing the
grouping variable (see examples below). The analysis is then run for every
group to compare group differences.
