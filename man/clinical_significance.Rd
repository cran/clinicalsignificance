\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy data frame}

\item{id}{Participant ID}

\item{time}{Time variable}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable}

\item{group}{Grouping variable}

\item{pre}{Pre measurement}

\item{post}{Post measurement}

\item{m_functional}{Mean of the functional population}

\item{sd_functional}{Standard deviation of the functional population}

\item{type}{Cutoff type. Available are \code{"a"}, \code{"b"}, and \code{"c"}. Defaults to
\code{"a"} (see details for further information in which cutoff to choose)}

\item{reliability}{The instrument's reliability estimate. If you selected the
NK method, the here specified reliability will be the instrument's pre
measurement reliability}

\item{reliability_post}{The instrument's reliability at post measurement.
This is only relevant for the NK method}

\item{better_is}{Which direction means a better outcome for the employed
outcome? Available are
\itemize{
\item \code{"lower"} (lower outcome scores are desirable, the default) and
\item \code{"higher"} (higher outcome scores are desirable)
}}

\item{method}{Clinical significance method. Available are
\itemize{
\item \code{"JT"} (Jacobson & Truax, 1991, the default)
\item \code{"GLN"} (Gulliksen, Lord, and Novick; Hsu, 1989, Hsu, 1995)
\item \code{"HLL"} (Hsu, Linn & Nord; Hsu, 1989)
\item \code{"EN"} (Edwards & Nunnally; Speer, 1992)
\item \code{"NK"} (Nunnally & Kotsch, 1983), requires a reliability estimate at post
measurement. If this is not supplied, reliability and reliability_post
are assumed to be equal
\item \code{"HA"} (Hageman & Arrindell, 1999)
\item \code{"HLM"} (Hierarchical Linear Modeling; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002), requires
at least three measurements per patient

\value{
An S3 object of class \code{clinisig}
}
\description{
This function conducts a clinical significance analysis by determining which
patients changed reliably and moved from the clinical to the functional
population during a study.
}
\details{
By default, the JT method is used, but there are other methods implemented
(see description of arguments).

It is generally recommended to use cutoff \code{"c"}, thus, incorporating
information of the clinical and functional population into the cutoff
calculation.
