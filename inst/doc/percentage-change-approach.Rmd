## Introduction

The percentage-change approach defines clinical significance based on the **relative change** in a patient's score from baseline. This method is common in clinical trials where a specific reduction in symptoms, such as "a 50% improvement," is a primary endpoint for defining treatment response.

A change is considered clinically significant if it meets or exceeds a predefined **Percentage-Change Cutoff (PCC)**. For example, if the PCC is 50% (or 0.5), any patient who shows at least a 50% reduction in symptoms would be classified as "Improved".

A key consideration for this method is that it is **highly dependent on the patient's baseline score**. A 10-point drop is a 50% improvement for a patient starting at 20 points, but only a 25% improvement for a patient starting at 40 points. This characteristic should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.

This vignette demonstrates how to use the `cs_percentage()` function to apply this approach.

```{r setup}
library(clinicalsignificance)
```

## Basic Analysis

Let's analyze the `claus_2020` dataset. A common benchmark for depression treatment trials is a 50% reduction in symptom scores. We will set this as our `pct_improvement` cutoff.

```{r pct-basic}
# Analyze change using a 50% improvement cutoff
pct_results <- claus_2020 |>
  cs_percentage(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    pct_improvement = 0.5
  )

summary(pct_results)
```

The summary shows that based on this 50% criterion, about 28% of patients are classified as having improved.

### Visualizing the Results

The plot for the percentage-change approach looks similar to those for the anchor- and distribution-based methods. However, the shaded area is now determined by the percentage-change cutoff relative to each individual's starting score. This means the boundaries of the "unchanged" area are not parallel lines.

```{r pct-basic-plot}
plot(pct_results)
```

## Grouped Analysis

We can also explore if the proportion of "responders" differs between the treatment groups (TAU vs. PA).

```{r pct-grouped}
# Grouped analysis with a 50% improvement cutoff
pct_grouped <- claus_2020 |>
  cs_percentage(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    pct_improvement = 0.5,
    group = treatment
  )

summary(pct_grouped)
```
The results suggest that a much higher proportion of patients in the Placebo Amplification (PA) group (42.9%) achieved a 50% symptom reduction compared to the Treatment as Usual (TAU) group (10.5%).

The plot clearly visualizes this difference:
```{r pct-grouped-plot}
plot(pct_grouped)
```


## Using Different Cutoffs for Improvement and Deterioration

A useful feature of `cs_percentage()` is the ability to set different cutoffs for improvement and deterioration via the `pct_deterioration` argument. For instance, in some contexts, a small worsening of symptoms (e.g., 20%) might already be considered a significant deterioration, while a larger change (e.g., 50%) is required for improvement.

```{r pct-different-cutoffs}
pct_asymmetric <- claus_2020 |>
  cs_percentage(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    pct_improvement = 0.5,
    pct_deterioration = 0.2 # A smaller threshold for worsening
  )

summary(pct_asymmetric)
