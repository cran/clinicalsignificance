## Introduction

The anchor-based approach is one of the most intuitive methods for evaluating clinical significance. It answers a straightforward question: **"Did the patient's change on an outcome measure meet or exceed a predefined threshold for what is considered meaningful?"**

This threshold is known as the **Minimal Important Difference (MID)**. The MID is the smallest change in a score that patients perceive as beneficial. It serves as an external "anchor" to determine if an observed change is practically relevant.

This vignette will guide you through using the `cs_anchor()` function to perform both individual- and group-level analyses using this approach.

```{r setup}
library(clinicalsignificance)
```

## Individual-Level Analysis

At the individual level, we classify each participant based on whether their change score crosses the MID.

### A Basic Example
We will use the `claus_2020` dataset, which contains data from a study on enhancing the placebo effect of antidepressants. The primary outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), where lower scores indicate improvement. For the BDI-II, a change of **7 points** is often considered the MID.

The `claus_2020` dataset has four measurements per patient. For a pre-post analysis, we must specify which time points to compare using the `pre` and `post` arguments.

```{r individual-basic}
# Analyze individual change from the first to the fourth measurement
anchor_individual <- claus_2020 |> 
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 7
  )

# Print the summary table
anchor_individual
```

The output shows that 62.5% of patients were classified as "Improved" (their BDI-II score decreased by 7 points or more), 27.5% were "Unchanged", and 10% "Deteriorated".

### Visualizing Individual Change

A clinical significance plot helps visualize these results. Each point represents a patient.

* **Solid Diagonal Line**: No change (`pre` = `post`). Points below this line represent improvement for the BDI-II.
* **Shaded Area**: The zone of "no meaningful change". Its boundaries are `post = pre ± MID`.
* **Points below the shaded area**: Clinically significant improvement.
* **Points above the shaded area**: Clinically significant deterioration.

```{r individual-plot}
plot(anchor_individual)
```

### Analyzing by Group

The `claus_2020` study included a Treatment as Usual (TAU) group and a Placebo-Amplification (PA) group. We can analyze the clinical significance for each group by specifying the `group` argument.

```{r individual-grouped}
anchor_grouped <- claus_2020 |> 
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 7,
    group = treatment
  )

# Print results by group
summary(anchor_grouped)

# Plot results by group
plot(anchor_grouped)
```
The plot clearly shows that more patients in the PA group (yellow points) achieved a clinically significant improvement compared to the TAU group (blue points).

### Handling "Positive" Outcomes

Some instruments measure constructs where higher scores are better (e.g., quality of life). For these, we must set `better_is = "higher"`. Let's analyze the `who` (WHO-5 Well-Being Index) outcome from the same dataset, assuming an MID of 4.

```{r positive-outcome}
anchor_positive <- claus_2020 |> 
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = who,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 4,
    better_is = "higher"
  )

plot(anchor_positive)
```
Now, points *above* the shaded area represent clinically significant improvement.


## Group-Level Analysis

The anchor-based approach can also be applied at the group level to determine if the *average* change for a group was clinically meaningful. `cs_anchor()` uses a Bayesian framework by default to generate a credible interval for the mean difference.

We set `target = "group"` to perform this analysis.

### Within-Group Analysis

First, let's assess the average change within each treatment group separately.

```{r group-within}
anchor_group_within <- claus_2020 |> 
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 7,
    target = "group",
    group = treatment
  )

anchor_group_within
```
The results indicate that the TAU group's change was not statistically significant, while the PA group showed a "Large clinically significant effect" because its entire 95% credible interval for the mean change was beyond the MID of -7.

### Between-Group Comparison

Perhaps the most common use case is comparing the change in an intervention group relative to a control group. We can do this by setting `effect = "between"`. The function will calculate the difference in change scores between the groups.

```{r group-between}
anchor_group_between <- claus_2020 |> 
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    post = 4, # Only post is needed here, as we compare change scores
    mid_improvement = 7,
    target = "group",
    group = treatment,
    effect = "between"
  )

anchor_group_between
```

The analysis shows a "Probably clinically significant effect" in favor of the PA group. The average difference between the groups exceeded the MID, but the MID was still within the 95% credible interval.

## Summary and Next Steps

The anchor-based approach provides a highly interpretable assessment of meaningful change, but its use depends on having a well-established MID for your outcome measure.

* Use `cs_anchor()` for **individual-level** analysis to classify each patient as improved, unchanged, or deteriorated.
* Use `cs_anchor(target = "group")` for **group-level** analysis to assess if the average change was meaningful.

When an MID is not available, other methods are required. The next vignette explores the **distribution-based approach**, which assesses whether a change is statistically reliable and larger than what might be expected from measurement error alone.
