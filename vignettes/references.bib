Several scales are commonly used for assessing pain intensity. Among them, the numerical rating scale (NRS), visual analog scale (VAS), and verbal rating scale (VRS) are often used in clinical practice. However, no study has performed psychometric analyses of their reliability and validity in the measurement of osteoarthritic (OA) pain. Therefore, the present study examined the test-retest reliability, validity, and minimum detectable change (MDC) of the VAS, NRS, and VRS for the measurement of OA knee pain. In addition, the correlations of VAS, NRS, and VRS with demographic variables were evaluated.

Methods

The study included 121 subjects (65 women, 56 men; aged 40-80 years) with OA of the knee. Test-retest reliability of the VAS, NRS, and VRS was assessed during two consecutive visits in a 24 h interval. The validity was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficients between the baseline scores of VAS, NRS, and VRS and the demographic variables (age, body mass index [BMI], sex, and OA grade). The standard error of measurement (SEM) and the MDC were calculated to assess statistically meaningful changes.

Results

The intraclass correlation coefficients of the VAS, NRS, and VRS were 0.97, 0.95, and 0.93, respectively. VAS, NRS, and VRS were significantly related to demographic variables (age, BMI, sex, and OA grade). The SEM of VAS, NRS, and VRS was 0.03, 0.48, and 0.21, respectively. The MDC of VAS, NRS, and VRS was 0.08, 1.33, and 0.58, respectively.

Conclusion

All the three scales had excellent test-retest reliability. However, the VAS was the most reliable, with the smallest errors in the measurement of OA knee pain.},

Following the operational definition of clinically significant change offered by Jacobson, Follette, and Revenstorf (1984), several alternatives have been proposed because they were thought to be either more accurate or more sensitive to detecting meaningful change. In this study, we compared five methods using a sample of 386 outpatients who underwent treatment in routine clinical practice. Differences were found between methods, suggesting that the statistical method used to calculate clinical significance has an effect on estimates of meaningful change. The Jacobson method (Jacobson {\&} Truax, 1991) provided a moderate estimate of treatment effects and was recommended for use in outcome studies and research on clinically significant change, but future research is needed to validate this statistical method.},

A consensus meeting was convened by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) to provide recommendations for interpreting clinical importance of treatment outcomes in clinical trials of the efficacy and effectiveness of chronic pain treatments. A group of 40 participants from universities, governmental agencies, a patient self-help organization, and the pharmaceutical industry considered methodologic issues and research results relevant to determining the clinical importance of changes in the specific outcome measures previously recommended by IMMPACT for 4 core chronic pain outcome domains: (1) Pain intensity, assessed by a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale; (2) physical functioning, assessed by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory and Brief Pain Inventory interference scales; (3) emotional functioning, assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory and Profile of Mood States; and (4) participant ratings of overall improvement, assessed by the Patient Global Impression of Change scale. It is recommended that 2 or more different methods be used to evaluate the clinical importance of improvement or worsening for chronic pain clinical trial outcome measures. Provisional benchmarks for identifying clinically important changes in specific outcome measures that can be used for outcome studies of treatments for chronic pain are proposed.

PERSPECTIVE

Systematically collecting and reporting the recommended information needed to evaluate the clinical importance of treatment outcomes of chronic pain clinical trials will allow additional validation of proposed benchmarks and provide more meaningful comparisons of chronic pain treatments.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Reports of the overall chronic pain prevalence and its associated demographic characteristics among adolescents vary greatly across existing studies. Using internationally comparable data, this study investigates age, sex and country-level effects in the prevalence of chronic single-site and multi-site pain among adolescents during the last six months preceding the survey.

METHODS

Data (n~=~214,283) from the 2013/2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study were used including nationally representative samples of 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds from general schools in 42 participating countries. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used.

RESULTS

The overall proportion of adolescents reporting chronic weekly pain during the last six months was high (44.2{\%}). On average, in comparison with different specific localized types of single-site pain, the prevalence of multi-site pain was more common varying from 13.2{\%} in Armenia to 33.8{\%} in Israel. Adolescent age and sex were strong predictors for reporting pain, but significantly different demographic patterns were found in the cross-country analyses. The most consistent findings indicate that multi-site pain was more prevalent among girls across all countries and that the prevalence increased with age.

CONCLUSIONS

Internationally comparable data suggest that self-reported chronic pain among adolescents is highly prevalent, but different age and sex patterns across countries exist. Adolescents with chronic pain are not a homogenous group. Chronic pain co-occurrence and differences in chronic pain characteristics should be addressed in both clinical and public health practice for effective adolescent chronic pain management and prevention.

SIGNIFICANCE

Chronic pain co-occurrence is common during adolescence across countries, the prevalence being among girls and in older age groups. Significant cross-country variations in the chronic pain prevalence and chronic pain patterns among adolescents exist. Significant country differences emerge for specific chronic pain patterns in association with adolescent demographics.},

The aim of this study was to assess the economic cost of chronic pain among adolescents receiving interdisciplinary pain treatment. Information was gathered from 149 adolescents (ages 10-17) presenting for evaluation and treatment at interdisciplinary pain clinics in the United States. Parents completed a validated measure of family economic attributes, the Client Service Receipt Inventory, to report on health service use and productivity losses due to their child's chronic pain retrospectively over 12 months. Health care costs were calculated by multiplying reported utilization estimates by unit visit costs from the 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The estimated mean and median costs per participant were {\$}11,787 and {\$}6,770, respectively. Costs were concentrated in a small group of participants; the top 5{\%} of those patients incurring the highest costs accounted for 30{\%} of total costs, whereas the lower 75{\%} of participants accounted for only 34{\%} of costs. Total costs to society for adolescents with moderate to severe chronic pain were extrapolated to {\$}19.5 billion annually in the United States. The cost of adolescent chronic pain presents a substantial economic burden to families and society. Future research should focus on predictors of increased health services use and costs in adolescents with chronic pain.

PERSPECTIVE

This cost of illness study comprehensively estimates the economic costs of chronic pain in a cohort of treatment-seeking adolescents. The primary driver of costs was direct medical costs followed by productivity losses. Because of its economic impact, policy makers should invest resources in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic pediatric pain.},

Now, it has been realised that psychological and psychosocial factors may substantially influence pain perception in patients with chronic pain and thus may influence the surgical outcome.

The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a 3-week multimodal inpatient pain program for children and adolescents with chronic pain.

METHODS

Effectiveness was investigated for pain-related variables (pain intensity, pain-related disability) and emotional distress in 3 ways: (1) in terms of statistically significant changes; (2) in terms of the clinical significance of these changes by creating post-hoc outcome groups for pain-related variables and emotional distress; and (3) in terms of the clinically significant overall amelioration generalizing the outcome over 3 variables (ie, pain intensity, pain-related disability, and school absence). One hundred sixty-seven adolescents (aged between 11 and 18 y) with various pain disorders (50{\%} with headache) who met inpatient criteria were evaluated at baseline and 3 months posttreatment.

RESULTS

Patients demonstrated statistically significant changes in all variables with large to medium effect sizes. Seventy-two percent and 45{\%} of the patients demonstrated clinically significant changes in pain intensity and pain-related disability, respectively. The percentages of patients demonstrating clinically significant change in emotional distress ranged from 13{\%} to 26{\%}. Seventy-seven adolescents demonstrated overall amelioration.

DISCUSSION

Results of the study are promising in at least 2 ways: (1) a multimodal inpatient program might stop the negative effects of chronic pain, disability, and emotional distress in children and adolescents, and (2) the exploration of clinical significance testing has demonstrated utility and can be applied to future effectiveness studies in pediatric pain.},

To investigate the long-term effectiveness of a 3-week multimodal inpatient program for children and adolescents with chronic pain.

METHODS

167 adolescents were evaluated at pretreatment baseline, 3-, and 12-month follow-up. Long-term effectiveness was investigated for pain-related variables (pain-related disability, school absence, pain intensity) and emotional distress.

RESULTS

We found statistically and clinically significant changes in all variables. After 1 year, the majority (56{\%}) showed overall improvement as indexed by decreased pain-related disability or school absence. 22{\%} had an unsuccessful treatment outcome. Those showing only short-term improvements had higher levels of emotional distress at baseline.

CONCLUSIONS

1 year after completing a multimodal inpatient program adolescents report less chronic pain, disability, and emotional distress. Clinically significant changes remain stable. Adolescents with high levels of emotional distress at admission may require special attention to maintain positive treatment outcomes. Specialized inpatient therapy is effective for children with chronic pain.},

To describe school absences in adolescents with Juvenile Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome (JPFS) and examine the relationship between school absenteeism, pain, psychiatric symptoms, and maternal pain history.

METHODS

Adolescents with JPFS (N = 102; mean age 14.96 years) completed measures of pain and depressive symptoms, and completed a psychiatric interview. Parents provided information about the adolescents' school absences, type of schooling, and parental pain history. School attendance reports were obtained directly from schools.

RESULTS

Over 12{\%} of adolescents with JPFS were homeschooled. Those enrolled in regular school missed 2.9 days per month on average, with one-third of participants missing more than 3 days per month. Pain and maternal pain history were not related to school absenteeism. However, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with school absences.

CONCLUSION

Many adolescents with JPFS experience difficulties with regular school attendance. Long-term risks associated with school absenteeism and the importance of addressing psychological factors are discussed.},

Studies of pain prevalence rates in children and adolescents published in English or French between 1991 and 2009 were identified using EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases. Of 185 published papers yielded by the search, 58 met inclusion criteria and were reviewed, and 41 were included in the review. Two independent reviewers screened papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the quality of studies. Prevalence rates ranged substantially, and were as follows: headache: 8-83{\%}; abdominal pain: 4-53{\%}; back pain: 14-24{\%}; musculoskeletal pain: 4-40{\%}; multiple pains: 4-49{\%}; other pains: 5-88{\%}. Pain prevalence rates were generally higher in girls and increased with age for most pain types. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with higher pain prevalence especially for headache. Most studies did not meet quality criteria.},

Prevalence estimates of severe chronic pain in pediatric community samples are rare and inconclusive. This study aimed to (1) examine the prevalence of chronic pain severity grades in school children and (2) investigate differences between pain severity grades for pain-related characteristics, including pain locations, sociodemographic characteristics, emotional functioning, insomnia, school factors, and health care utilization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This cross-sectional observational study was conducted with 2220 school students in Germany (52{\%} female individuals, age: M=13.0; SD=1.8; range, 10 to 18 y). Pain severity was assessed using the validated Chronic Pain Grades for adolescents. Comparisons between Chronic Pain Grade subgroups of adolescent characteristics were conducted using \textgreek{q}2 tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and 1-way analysis of variance.

RESULTS

In school students, 31.0{\%} had chronic pain with 8.2{\%} categorized as severe. Individuals with higher pain severity tended to be girls and have multisite pain, more symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety, and a higher emotional burden of pain. Individuals with higher pain severity also reported less school satisfaction, lower perceived school performance, and more insomnia. Pain medication intake and physician visits because of pain were more common in those with more severe pain.

DISCUSSION

Severe chronic pain affects nearly 1 in 10 adolescent school students and is associated with several negative health outcomes and increased health care utilization. It is important to ensure that specialized pain treatment programs are available to these students and that they are aware of the different negative health outcomes associated with the pain condition.},

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) underwent revision in 1996 (BDI-II) with the goal of addressing DSM-IV depression criteria. The present study assessed psychometric properties of the German version of the BDI-II.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

The BDI-II was translated into German and evaluated in a series of studies with clinical and nonclinical samples.

RESULTS

The content validity of the BDI-II has improved by following DSM-IV symptom criteria. Internal consistency was satisfactorily high (alpha{\textgreater}or=0.84), and retest reliability exceeded r{\textgreater}or=0.75 in nonclinical samples. Associations with construct-related scales (depression, dysfunctional cognitive constructs) were high, while those with nonsymptomatic personality assessment (NEO-FFI) were lower. The BDI-II differentiated well between different grades of depression and was sensitive to change.

CONCLUSION

The German BDI-II demonstrates good reliability and validity in clinical and nonclinical samples. It may now replace the older version of the BDI for assessing self-rated severity of depression and course of depressed symptoms under treatment.},

This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

This report examined limitations in our ability to assess clinically significant change (CSC) in randomized controlled trials of treatments of self-reported pediatric chronic pain intensity.

METHODS

The following were reviewed: (a) approaches to assessing CSC; (b) approaches to assessing CSC used in psychological treatment studies of self-reported pediatric chronic pain intensity included in a recent systematic review; (c) the role of test-retest reliability in distribution-based CSC measures; (d) the test-retest reliability of recommended chronic pain measures.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

Existing studies do not assess whether a CSC occurred or use procedures that did not account for measurement error and true score fluctuations unrelated to treatment, possibly resulting in overestimating CSCs. Distribution-based approaches to assessing CSCs that address these problems require knowing test-retest reliability of the chronic pain measure at appropriate intervals. Available information raises concern about our ability to estimate CSC reliably. Recommendations are made for future research.},

Despite the availability of measures for assessing physical, psychological, and health impact in children with chronic pain, there are not established guidelines for interpretation of children's pain outcomes following psychological treatment. The purpose of this topical review is to discuss clinical significance as a neglected area of consideration in pediatric chronic pain assessment and to make recommendations on how the field can move toward benchmarking on core outcome domains.

METHOD

We review definitions of clinical significance and examples of several methodologies that have been used in other populations or are emerging in pediatric chronic pain including anchor-based methods, distribution-based methods, or multimethod approaches.

RESULTS

Few measures across pediatric chronic pain outcome domains have established clinical significance of scores to interpret meaningful change following treatment limiting the interpretability of findings from clinical trials. In the context of clinical practice, several efforts to examine clinical significance to improve the translation of evidence-based measurement into standard clinical decision-making exist.

CONCLUSIONS

Recommendations are provided to encourage additional validation efforts of outcome measures in pediatric chronic pain and to encourage authors to report clinical significance in clinical trials of psychological interventions for pediatric chronic pain.},

Interdisciplinary pain treatment has been shown to be effective for children and adolescents with chronic pain, both in an outpatient and inpatient setting. Until now, the effectiveness has been analyzed with various outcome measures. Although it has only rarely been used for adolescents so far, Chronic Pain Grading (CPG) developed by Von Korff could be an appropriate general outcome measure.

OBJECTIVE

The study aims at prospectively investigating and comparing the therapy outcome one year after initial presentation for both outpatients and inpatients using the CPG.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data of 258 adolescents were gathered at initial presentation and one year later and analyzed using the CPG. Changes from pretreatment to follow-up and predictors of good therapy outcome were investigated for the whole sample and separately for outpatients and inpatients.

RESULTS

Compared to inpatients, outpatients were characterized by a~lower CPG both before and one year after initial presentation. Large effects were found both for outpatient and inpatient therapy regarding the improvement of the CPG. In outpatient therapy, boys were two times more likely to display therapy success.

CONCLUSION

The study shows that the CPG is an appropriate outcome measure to display the long-term effectiveness of an inpatient and outpatient interdisciplinary pain treatment. The interdisciplinary pain treatment needs to be better tailored to girls to improve its effectiveness.},

The chronic pain grading (CPG), a standard approach to classify the severity of pain conditions in adults, combines the characteristics of pain intensity and pain-related disability. However, in children and adolescents, the CPG has only been validated in a school sample, but not in the actual target population, i.e., clinical populations with pain.

METHODS

In the present study, we applied the CPG to a tertiary sample of adolescents with chronic pain (n=1242). Construct validity, sensitivity to change and prognostic utility were examined.

RESULTS

Results indicate that most adolescents were equally classified into the three higher severity grades. Higher CPG classification was associated with more pain locations, higher pain frequency, longer pain duration, extensive use of health care and more depressive symptoms. Adolescents with a high CPG received recommendations for inpatient treatment more often; however, the prognostic utility for therapy recommendation - as operationalized in this study - was low. Sensitivity to change was assessed via reassessment at follow-up for a subsample of 490 adolescents. The majority of adolescents improved to a less severe CPG; changes were more common in the high severity range.

CONCLUSION

The CPG may be applied to adolescent tertiary care samples and to assess outcomes in clinical trials. However, in this study it was not appropriate to assign adolescent patients to different treatment options. Future work should focus on developing a comprehensive assessment tool for assigning patients to different treatments.},

Findings on the short- and long-term effectiveness of intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) for children with severe chronic functional pain are promising. However, a definitive appraisal of long-term effectiveness cannot be made due to a lack of comparison groups. The aim of the present study was to compare the health status of former patients with the health status of an age- and sex-matched comparison group from the community.

METHODS

Data from two samples, a clinical sample of former patients (n~=~162; aged 14 to 26) and an age- and sex-matched community sample (n~=~162), were analysed. Former patients provided data 7~years after IIPT. Pain characteristics, physical and mental health status, autonomy, coping and health care utilisation were compared between the two samples.

RESULTS

Seven years after treatment, the majority (58{\%}) of the clinical sample were completely pain-free. Compared to the community sample, the clinical sample demonstrated worse physical and mental health and continued to seek more frequent health care, irrespective of whether or not they experienced ongoing chronic pain. However, the clinical sample reported better coping strategies and a comparable level of autonomy.

CONCLUSION

Patients experiencing severe chronic pain in childhood who engage in IIPT are likely to have recovered from their pain in early adulthood. Long-term treatment effects may manifest in better coping strategies. However, reduced mental and physical health status may indicate a negative long-term effect of early chronic pain experiences or a general vulnerability in people developing a chronic pain condition in childhood.

SIGNIFICANCE

The majority of severely impaired paediatric chronic pain patients no longer suffer from chronic pain seven years after intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment. However, former patients have worse physical and mental health status than a community sample, and continue to seek out more frequent health care utilisation, irrespective of whether or not they continue to experience chronic pain. Therefore, potential negative long-term effects of childhood chronic pain experiences need specific attention early on.},

Physical functioning is often impaired in adolescents with chronic pain, which has largely been demonstrated through subjective self-report measures. Actigraphy uses motion monitoring as an objective means for assessing one dimension of physical functioning; physical activity level. This study used subjective and objective measures to assess multiple dimensions of physical functioning in a clinical sample of adolescents with chronic pain (n = 78) and a comparison group of healthy adolescents (n = 59). Individual and pain characteristics were also examined as predictors of actigraphy variables within the chronic pain sample. Results indicated that adolescents with chronic pain demonstrate significant impairment in subjective measures of physical functioning and evidence lower levels of physical activity. Actigraphic measures of physical activity were moderately correlated with self-report measures of physical functioning. Individual characteristics, including adolescent age, sex, and Body Mass Index percentile, were associated with physical activity levels among adolescents with chronic pain. Physical activity represents a distinct dimension of physical functioning. Assessing physical activity may provide additional description of physical functioning among adolescents with chronic pain, and may help identify targets for intervention in this population.

PERSPECTIVE

This study demonstrates that adolescents with chronic pain have lower physical activity levels, as measured objectively via actigraphy, as well as poorer subjective reports of physical functioning, compared to healthy adolescents. Actigraphic measurement of physical activity provides objective source data about one dimension of physical functioning.},

Prevalence of pain as a recurrent symptom in children is known to be high, but little is known about children with high impairment from chronic pain seeking specialized treatment. The purpose of this study was the precise description of children with high impairment from chronic pain referred to the German Paediatric Pain Centre over a 5-year period.

METHODS

Demographic variables, pain characteristics and psychometric measures were assessed at the first evaluation. Subgroup analysis for sex, age and pain location was conducted and multivariate logistic regression applied to identify parameters associated with extremely high impairment.

RESULTS

The retrospective study consisted of 2249 children assessed at the first evaluation. Tension type headache (48{\%}), migraine (43{\%}) and functional abdominal pain (11{\%}) were the most common diagnoses with a high rate of co-occurrence; 18{\%} had some form of musculoskeletal pain disease. Irrespective of pain location, chronic pain disorder with somatic and psychological factors was diagnosed frequently (43{\%}). 55{\%} of the children suffered from more than one distinct pain diagnosis. Clinically significant depression and general anxiety scores were expressed by 24{\%} and 19{\%} of the patients, respectively. Girls over the age of 13 were more likely to seek tertiary treatment compared to boys. Nearly half of children suffered from daily or constant pain with a mean pain value of 6/10. Extremely high pain-related impairment, operationalized as a comprehensive measure of pain duration, frequency, intensity, pain-related school absence and disability, was associated with older age, multiple locations of pain, increased depression and prior hospital stays. 43{\%} of the children taking analgesics had no indication for pharmacological treatment.

CONCLUSION

Children with chronic pain are a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge as they often have two or more different pain diagnoses, are prone to misuse of analgesics and are severely impaired. They are at increased risk for developmental stagnation. Adequate treatment and referral are essential to interrupt progression of the chronic pain process into adulthood.},
