The **clinicalsignificance** R package provides a comprehensive toolkit
for analyzing **clinical significance** in intervention studies.

> **Why this package?** While *statistical* significance asks: *“Is this
> effect unlikely due to chance?”* Clinical significance asks: **“Does
> this intervention make a meaningful difference for the patient?”**

This package empowers researchers and practitioners to move beyond
p-values and assess the practical relevance of treatment outcomes.

## 🛠 Core Functions

The package implements the most widely used methods for clinical
significance analysis. Each approach answers a specific question:

- **`cs_anchor()`**: *Did the patient improve by a minimal amount?*
  Evaluates change based on a predefined **Minimal Important Difference
  (MID)**.
- **`cs_percentage()`**: *Did the patient improve by a certain
  percentage?* Assesses change relative to the baseline score.
- **`cs_distribution()`**: *Is the change reliable (beyond measurement
  error)?* Uses statistical distribution metrics like the **Reliable
  Change Index (RCI)**.
- **`cs_statistical()`**: *Did the patient return to a functional
  range?* Determines if a patient moved from a clinical to a
  **functional population**.
- **`cs_combined()`**: *The “Gold Standard” (e.g., Jacobson & Truax).*
  Combines reliability and cutoff criteria for a robust assessment.

## 📦 Installation

Install the stable version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("clinicalsignificance")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("benediktclaus/clinicalsignificance")
```

## 🚀 Example: The Combined Approach

Let’s look at the **combined approach** (Jacobson & Truax, 1991). We
want to know if patients in the `claus_2020` dataset (included in the
package) showed a **reliable change** AND moved into a **functional
population** range.

``` r
library(clinicalsignificance)
library(ggplot2)

# 1. Perform the analysis
results_combined <- claus_2020 |>
  cs_combined(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    reliability = 0.801,
    m_functional = 7.69,
    sd_functional = 7.52,
    cutoff_type = "c"
  )

# 2. Visualize the results
plot(results_combined, show_group = "category")
#> Ignoring unknown labels:
#> • colour : "Group"
```

<img src="man/figures/README-example-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**Interpreting the Plot:** \* **Recovered (Green):** Reliable
improvement + moved to functional range. \* **Improved (Blue):**
Reliable improvement, but still in clinical range. \* **Unchanged
(Grey):** No reliable change. \* **Deteriorated (Red):** Reliable
worsening.
