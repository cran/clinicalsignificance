The goal of this powerful package is to provide all necessary tools for
analyses of clinical significance in clinical intervention studies. In
contrast to *statistical* significance, which assesses if it is probable
that there is a treatment effect, *clinical* significance can be used to
determine if a treatment effect is of practical use or meaningful for
patients. This package is designed to help researchers and healthcare
professionals determine the clinical relevance of their findings. It
provides various functions and tools for quantifying and visualizing
clinical significance, making it easier to make informed decisions in
the medical field.

## Installation

You can install the clinicalsignificance package from CRAN using the
following command:

``` r
install.packages("clinicalsignificance")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("pedscience/clinicalsignificance")
```

## Main Functions

The main functions of the package are based on the main approaches for
clinical significance analyses, i.e., the anchor-based approach, the
percentage-change approach, the distribution-based approach, the
statistical, and combined approaches. Hence, the main functions are

- `cs_anchor()`
- `cs_percentage()`
- `cs_distribution()`
- `cs_statistical()`
- `cs_combined()`

See the package vignettes for additional details on the various clinical
significance approaches.

## Example

Claus et al. (2020) implemented a novel intervention to enhance the
effectiveness of antidepressants by boosting the inherent placebo effect
of that medication. The randomized patients to treatment as usual (TAU)
and a placebo amplification (PA) group and measured the severity of
depressive symptoms over time.

In the anchor-based approach, a clinical significant change is believed
to have occured if a given change is greater or equal to the minimally
important difference of the used instrument. Given a tidy dataset of the
study and a minimally important difference for the Beck Depression
Inventory (second edition, BDI-II) of 7 points, the study data by Claus
et al. (2020) may be analyzed as follows:

``` r
library(clinicalsignificance)

cs_results <- claus_2020 |>
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 7
  )

cs_results
#> 
#> ── Clinical Significance Results ──
#> 
#> Individual anchor-based approach with a 7 point decrease in instrument scores
#> indicating a clinical significant improvement.
#> Category     |  n | Percent
#> ---------------------------
#> Improved     | 25 |  62.50%
#> Unchanged    | 11 |  27.50%
#> Deteriorated |  4 |  10.00%
```

You can receive a detailed summary of the analysis by

``` r
summary(cs_results)
#> 
#> ── Clinical Significance Results ──
#> 
#> Individual anchor-based analysis of clinical significance with a 7 point
#> decrease in instrument scores (bdi) indicating a clinical significant
#> improvement.
#> There were 43 participants in the whole dataset of which 40 (93%) could be
#> included in the analysis.
#> 
#> ── Individual Level Results
#> Category     |  n | Percent
#> ---------------------------
#> Improved     | 25 |  62.50%
#> Unchanged    | 11 |  27.50%
#> Deteriorated |  4 |  10.00%
```

or plot the cs_results with

``` r
plot(cs_results)
```

### Including Groups

Group-wise results may be obtained by setting the `group` argument

``` r
cs_results_grouped <- claus_2020 |>
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 7,
    group = treatment
  )

summary(cs_results_grouped)
#> 
#> ── Clinical Significance Results ──
#> 
#> Individual anchor-based analysis of clinical significance with a 7 point
#> decrease in instrument scores (bdi) indicating a clinical significant
#> improvement.
#> There were 43 participants in the whole dataset of which 40 (93%) could be
#> included in the analysis.
#> 
#> ── Individual Level Results
#> Group |     Category |  n | Percent
#> -----------------------------------
#> TAU   |     Improved |  8 |  20.00%
#> TAU   |    Unchanged |  7 |  17.50%
#> TAU   | Deteriorated |  4 |  10.00%
#> PA    |     Improved | 17 |  42.50%
#> PA    |    Unchanged |  4 |  10.00%
#> PA    | Deteriorated |  0 |   0.00%

### Clinical Significance Categories

The individual categories may be visualized by adjusting the argument
`show` in the `plot()` function call.

``` r
plot(cs_results, show = category)
```
