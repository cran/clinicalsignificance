Description: A clinical significance analysis can be used to determine if an 
    intervention has a meaningful or practical effect for patients. You provide 
    a tidy data set plus a few more metrics and this package will take care of 
    it to make your results publication ready as proposed by Jacobson et al., 
    (1984) <doi:10.1016/S0005-7894(84)80002-7>.
