#' Calculate Change for the Percentage-Change Approach
#'
#' This is an internal generic and should not be called directly. Depending on
#' the different percent change cutoff requested by the user, this function
#' calculates the relative change according clinical significance category for
#' each patient.
#'
#' @inheritParams calc_rci
#' @param data A pre-processed data frame with at least columns `change` and
#'   `pre`
#' @param pct_improvement Numeric, the required percent change cutoff to infer
#'   an improvement
#' @param pct_deterioration Numeric, the required percent change cutoff to infer
#'   a deterioration
#'
#' @return An object of classm `cs_percentage` list with participant-wise info
#'   on clinical significant change catergory
