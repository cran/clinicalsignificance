#' Placebo Amplification Data
#'
#' A dataset containing the data from Claus et al. (2020). In a routine
#' inpatient setting for unipolar depressive disorders they implemented an
#' intervention that sought to amplify the placebo response of antidepressants.
#' In the study, two groups were compared: treatment as usual (TAU) and placebo
#' amplification (PA). Participants were examined four times during their
#' treatment.
