#' Placebo Amplification Data
#'
#' A dataset containing the data from Claus et al. (2020). In a routine
#' inpatient setting for unipolar depressive disorders they implemented an
#' intervention that sought to amplify the placebo response of antidepressants.
#' In the study, two groups were compared: treatment as usual (TAU) and placebo
#' amplification (PA). Participants were examined four times during their
#' treatment.

#'Antidepressant Data
#'
#'A fictional dataset used to showcase group-based clinical significance
#'analyses and analyses with many participants.
#'
#'In a fictional clinical trial, the effectiveness of a new antidepressant
#'should be examined and depressed patients were randomized to one of four
#'groups:
#'- A wait list control group that did not receive a medication
#'- An inactive placebo group, i.e., a group that received a placebo
#'(inert substance without proposed clinical effect) pill
#'- An active placebo group, i.e., a group that received a placebo that evokes
#'side effects like mild nausea or a dry mouth
#'- The antidepressant group, so the target medication of this trial that should
#'have a clinical impact on the patients' depressive symptoms
#'
#'Suppose they underwent outpatient treatment, depressive symptoms were measured
#'before and after treatment with the Mind over Mood Depression Inventory
#'(MoM-DI) by Greenberger & Padesky (2015), and if a patient received a pill,
#'the clinician and the patient did not know, what type of medicaction they
#'consumed.
#'
#'Further, the minimal important difference for an improvement as measured by
#'this instrument was agreed to be an 8 point decrease. A deterioration can be
#'assumed if instrument scores increased by 5 points.
#'
#'The functional population (i.e., non-depressed individuals) can be expected to
#'have a mean score of M = 8 points with a standard deviation of SD = 7.
